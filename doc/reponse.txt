There is a point in the center of a rectangle with the width of 980 and the height of 660 pixels (or millimeters on paper). The north-west corner of the rectangle has zero coordinates (x = 0, y = 0). Positive x numbers go towards the east of the rectangle. Positive y numbers go towards the south of the rectangle.

Draw a line on paper of the length of 120 pixels (millimeters) from the center of the rectangle under the angle of 33 degrees towards the south-east of the rectangle. This is only to help you calculate the following:

Given the center of the rectangle as the starting point and the angle of 33 degrees, calculate the end point of the line.

*** The coordinates of the end point of the line is: (555.3566842018032, 430.6404681534509)
